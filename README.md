**Analysis by: Collins Kemboi**

### Objective of the Project;

1. A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want
to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from 
various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the
same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your 
services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are
most likely to click on her ads. 

2. Kira Plastinina (Links to an external site.) is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year.
